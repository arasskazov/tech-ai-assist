* [cadrille: Multi-modal CAD Reconstruction with Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22914) Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches
in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.
